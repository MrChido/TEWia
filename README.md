Lets find out who are the industry mougls in Tiny Epic Western

There are 3 industries in the game: The mining, The railways, and The wagons. 
The properties bought during the six rounds of play have values consisting of these 3 types.
At the end of the game, the person how has the most or second most will reap extra points for being the mogul,
or as the Instruction book says, majoity share.

This web app will, can help tally up who has how much influence on these 3 industries and determine who gets the extra points.
